The file named as Model.py can be used by only defining the desired parameters.

In order to do that, open the Model.py file, go to line 332, and set 'qe = network()' with the desired parameters.

Those parameters are the following:  neurons,N,J_e,J_i,C_e,C_i,I,v_freq,gamma,a,g,c_theta,c_sigma,t_init,t_end

neurons - > Number of neurons in the network
N -> Number of total time steps
J_e -> Excitatory synaptic strength
J_i -> Inhibitory synaptic strength 
C_e -> number of excitatory connection each neuron receives
C_i -> number of inhibitory connection each neuron receives
I -> external constant input
v_freq -> Poisson input rate
gamma -> C_i/C_e
a -> adaptation 
g -> relative synaptic strength
c_theta -> membrane constant
c_sigma -> Ïƒ value (Euler)
t_init -> Starting time of simulation
t_end -> Ending time of simulation

***  In order to define the range of each time step,  (t_end - t_init) / N  should be calculated. ***

In LIF model, the minimum time step which provides sufficient results is 0.0005.

After setting the desired values for all those parameters at line 332, press F5 to run the code. 
The simulation time depends highly on the number of neurons, time range and time step.
